## Chord of the Day

I started this little project as a way to create a habit of exploring new sounds and getting out of my comfort zone in guitar playing. The *Chord of the Day* project sends a daily email with a randomly generated chord. Sometimes you might receive beginner chords, like a simple C major, and other times you might get something more complicated, like a D#m6add9. There are over 50 different types of chords, for 12 roots notes, so more than 600 different chords! 

If you want a brief introduction to how chords are constructed, and how the code works, you can check out <a href = "./blog/chord_of_the_day.html" target = "_blank">this</a> blog entry. I have also written down a simple chart to help you identify the notes on the fretboard based on their position and build the chords. You can find it <a href = "guitar_chart.html" target = "_blank">here</a>.

Each email includes the name of the chord, what positions of the major scale construct the chord, a reminder of what is the major scale for that particular root note, and the specific notes that compose the chord. This project is at an early development stage, so I expect to add msore features, including suggested chord diagrams (remember there are many ways to play the same chord!).
