## Coffee and Cafés

One of my biggest passions is specialty coffee. I frequently spend hours in coffee shops reading, and a few years ago I started talking to the baristas and owners trying to learn more about the coffee I was served. Where it came from, what process did the beans go through, how was it brewed. I discovered it was a fantastically complex world. During my masters degree, I explored this passion further by joining the Coffee Society of my College, participating in tastings, visits to cafés, and learning lots. Brewing coffee is an important part of my days, a very slow and relaxing time for myself. 

### My Café Map

I have created a Café Map, with my favorite coffeeshops in different parts of the world. Check it out here:

### Beans

I collect the bags of coffee I drink. This picture shows most of the beans that accompanied me during my time at the LSE:

My prefered flavour profile is floral/fruity, with remarked acidity and medium sweetness.

Some of the beans I enjoyed brewing the most were:  
* _La Fila_ by The Barn Coffee Roasters - Sweet Honduras Washed with Plum Jam notes  
* _Sweet Valley - Granja La Esperanza_ by Red Bank Coffee - A nice Colombian Natural with a strong Riesling finish    
* _Tsebel_ by Origin Coffee - Complex Ethiopia Natural with Strawberry and Dark Chocolate notes.

### How do I brew?

At the moment, I grind my beans using a Comandante C40 MKIII Nitro Blade - Bamboo. I use a plastic V60 01 and 02 with traditional Hario paper filters, and an Aeropress.
