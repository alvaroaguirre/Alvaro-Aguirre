## Coffee

One of my biggest passions is specialty coffee. I frequently spend hours in coffee shops reading, and a few years ago I started talking to the baristas and owners trying to learn more about the coffee I was served. Where it came from, what process did the beans go through, how was it brewed. I discovered it was a fantastically complex world. During my masters degree, I explored this passion further by joining the Coffee Society of my College, participating in tastings, visits to cafés, and learning lots. Brewing coffee is an important part of my days, a very slow and relaxing time for myself. 

I have an Instagram account where I post some brewing videos and other coffee related things: [@alvrew](https://www.instagram.com/alvrew/).

### Beans

I collect the bags of coffee I drink. This picture shows most of the beans that accompanied me during my time at the LSE:

Some of the beans I enjoyed the most were:  
_La Fila_ by The Barn Coffee Roasters - Sweet Honduras Washed with Plum Jam notes  
_Los Naranjos_ by Kiss The Hippo - A nice Colombian Washed with Jasmin notes  
_Tsebel_ by Origin Coffee - Complex Ethiopia Natural with Strawberry and Dark Chocolate notes.

### My gear

At the moment, I grind my beans using a Comandante C40 MKIII Nitro Blade - Bamboo. I use a plastic V60 01 and 02 with traditional Hario paper filters, and an Aeropress. I use either Tesco Ashbeck Still Natural Mineral Water, or filtered water using a Brita jug. My server is a Kinto 600ml.
