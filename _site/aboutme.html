      <h2 id="who-am-i-and-what-am-i-up-to">Who am I and what am I up to?</h2>

<p>I am a Graduate student at the LSE pursuing a M.Sc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (more info about my program <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2019/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics">here</a>) with a full scholarship from the <a href="https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/">Fundación Ramón Areces</a>. Currently, my main areas of interest are non-linear dynamics, bounded rationality and contest theory.</p>

<p>I hold a BSc in Economics from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid (graduated summa cum laude), and spent a year as a visiting student at UC Berkeley. After LSE, I will spend the summer working on risk forecasting code at the Systemic Risk Center, and then join Bain &amp; Company as an Associate Consultant.</p>

<p>I am passionate about data, technology, books and coffee. Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/alvaroaguirre">my github</a> to find some of the projects I have been working on. You will be able to find a repository of my solutions to some <a href="https://projecteuler.net">Project Euler</a> problems, some interesting code to learn about Non-linear Dynamics, and some other Econ code I have previously worked on.</p>

<p>You can find my complete CV <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9xs8m1rikbwz24m/CV_AlvaroAguirre.pdf?dl=0">here</a>.</p>

<p>After finishing my bachelor’s degree, I spent a year working at Amazon. I was a Project Manager for the Kindle team and led various projects that involved diving deep into data to solve fun problems or improve internal processes. Most of the projects used a mix of SQL, VBA, Amazon Redshift, HTML, DaraWarehousing, and R. I also organized and gave workshops on SQL coding and how to pose and answer interesting questions using data.</p>

<p>Before Amazon, I worked at a small consulting firm in Madrid doing Econometrics modeling, trying to find causal effects. The project consisted on measuring the impact of a training program for insurance managers of the largest Spanish bank on sales. I mainly used STATA for the analysis and regressions.</p>

<p>I love books (and have to admit I have a bit of a shopaholic problem with them). Reading has been my passion since I was a kid, so if you have Goodreads, make sure to <a href="http://goodreads.com/alvaroaguirrem">add me as a friend</a> so we can keep each other updated. And please send me an email with your favorite book so I can read it!</p>

<p>In 2017 I graduated from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid with a BSc in Economics. I earned the “Premio Extraordinario de Fin de Carrera” for graduating with the best academic record amongst my cohort. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/mguz894hexzxpkp/Premio-madre.jpg?dl=0">Here</a> is a picture of me receiving the award next to my biggest supporter (my mom!). My Bachelors’ Thesis has been published in the VII edition of the Berkeley Economic Review, you can find it <a href="https://issuu.com/berkeleyeconreview/docs/berkeley_economic_review_volume_vii">here</a>.</p>

<p>I received a scholarship to be a visiting student at the University of California, Berkeley, during 2015 and 2016. Here I discovered and explored several fascinating fields of economics, in particular, development and behavioral caught my attention. There I found out what coding was and heard the term “machine learning” for the first time, since it was the topic of almost every conversation in the Bay Area. I found it extremely interesting and am looking forward to learn more about it. 
Nothing says Berkeley more than a <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3ybj9ffmw2c8sb/Photo%2018-04-2016%2C%2008%2039%2025.jpg?dl=0">picture with a bear</a>, or <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/0od0d4nofx8gpvg/Photo%2003-11-2015%2C%2005%2056%2028.jpg?dl=0">one at the Oracle Arena</a> after watching the GSW destroy another team!</p>

<p>I am originally from Perú, and I grew up in a city called Ayacucho, in the highlands of the country. If you have heard about it, probably it is because it was the area most stricken by terrorism in Peru in the 80s and 90s. It is a beautiful place so I highly recommend you check it out if you are in Perú sometime. Take a look at the <a href="https://img.elcomercio.pe/files/article_content_ec_fotos/uploads/2018/03/30/5abef95f528f5.jpeg">Plaza Mayor</a>, or at <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wmu5a48879q9d5/Photo%2016-05-2017%2C%2000%2032%2054.jpg?dl=0">this picture</a> of me as a kid hanging out with an alpaca.</p>
