        <h2 id="home">Home</h2>

<p>Welcome to my website. Here you will find information about me, what I am up to, the projects I have worked on, and things I am passionate about.</p>

<h3 id="about-me">About Me</h3>

<p>Originally Peruvian, from a small <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayacucho">city</a> in the Andes, but have been living between Madrid, california, and London for the past 10 years. I’m fascinated by how humans and organisations make decisions. I am an economist by training, with a postgraduate degree in the intersection between mathematics, economics, and statistics; and interests in psychology and linguistics.</p>

<p>My goal is to use data and technology with a purpose.</p>

<h3 id="what-am-i-up-to">What am I up to?</h3>

<p>I am a Deployment Strategist at <a href="https://www.palantir.com/" target="_blank">Palantir Technologies</a> in London, using data to solve some of the world’s most complex problems. I believe thinking critically about data does only give you answers, but more importantly, it allows you to ask the right questions. I try to keep one foot in the technical world, and the other in the business/organisational world.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working with England’s National Health Service to help them tackle the long waiting lists in Elective Care. You can read more of the work I am involved in <a href="https://blog.palantir.com/understanding-our-work-with-the-nhs-6d451beea022">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="outside-work">Outside work</h3>

<p>You will usually find me playing guitar (neo-soul / jazz / blues / funk), going to gigs, brewing unnecessarily fancy coffee, reading, taking photographs on old film cameras, playing basketball, geoguessing, and occassionally baking sourdough.</p>

<h3 id="past-experiences">Past experiences</h3>

<p>I’ve had the chance of doing several different things through my career. I previously led an analytics vertical at a global food delivery player, responsible of a stream that accounted for over 20M yearly orders and half a billion euros in revenue. I also worked at another major tech company using data to help indie authors make a living out of writing, and developing fraud detection models that saved millions every month. I spent some time working in strategy consulting at one of the top firms, where I had the great opportunity of exploring different industries and project types, from leading smallholder-farming mechanization projects for in East Africa, to performing analytical customer segmentation for a European retail brand. And finally, as a quant in a financial research center, where I worked with academics and hedge funds in building trading algorithms and financial engineering projects for asset pricing simulating stochastic differential equations.</p>

<h3 id="education">Education</h3>

<p>I received a Masters Degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics with Distinction from the London School of Economics (more info <a href="https://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2022/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics" target="_blank">here</a>), with a full scholarship from the <a href="https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/" target="_blank">Fundación Ramón Areces</a>. Previously, I earned a BSc in Economics from the Universdad Carlos III de Madrid, graduating summa cum laude. I also spent a year as a visiting student at UC Berkeley.</p>

<p>Most of my work is in R, but some other projects involved using Python, Julia, and MATLAB. <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/which-programming-language-best-economic-research" target="_blank">Here</a> you will find a VOX EU article I wrote with Jon Danielsson on the comparison of these four languages for economic research (Most read VOX EU piece for a month after its publication).</p>

<p>You can get my CV <a href="/assets/docs/CV_AlvaroAguirre.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
