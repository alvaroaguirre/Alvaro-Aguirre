<p>Welcome to my personal webpage. Here you will find information about me, what I am currently up to, the projects I have worked on, and things I am passionate about, like specialty coffee and film photography.</p>

<h3 id="who-am-i-and-what-am-i-up-to">Who am I and what am I up to?</h3>

<p>I am Alvaro. I like data, math, coffee, film photography, and cool books.</p>

<p>Currently, I am working as a Summer Researcher at the <a href="http://www.systemicrisk.ac.uk">Systemic Risk Centre</a>. My work consists of developing code in Julia, Python, R, and MATLAB for financial risk forecasting algorithms. After the summer, I will spend a few months off before joining <a href="https://www.bain.com">Bain &amp; Company</a> in January 2021 as an Associate Consultant in the Madrid office.</p>

<p>I recently completed my masters degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics at the London School of Economics (more info on my program <a href="http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2019/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics">here</a>), with a full scholarship from the <a href="https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/">Fundación Ramón Areces</a>. Previously, I earned a BSc in Economics from the Universdad Carlos III de Madrid, graduating summa cum laude. I also spent a year as a visiting student at UC Berkeley.</p>

<h3 id="what-have-i-done-before">What have I done before?</h3>

<p>After finishing my bachelor’s degree, I spent a year working at Amazon. I was a Project Manager focused on Data for the Kindle team. I led various projects that involved diving deep into data to solve fun problems or improve internal processes. Most of the projects used a mix of SQL, VBA, Amazon Redshift, HTML, DaraWarehousing, and R. I also organized and gave workshops on SQL coding and how to pose and answer interesting questions using data.</p>

<p>Before Amazon, I worked at a small consulting firm in Madrid doing Econometrics modeling, trying to find causal effects. The project consisted on measuring the impact of a training program for insurance managers of the largest Spanish bank on sales. I mainly used STATA for the analysis and regressions.</p>
