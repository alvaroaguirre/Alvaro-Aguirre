## Useful and useless information

I love books (and have to admit I have a bit of a shopaholic problem with them). Reading has been my passion since I was a kid, so if you have Goodreads, make sure to [add me as a friend](http://goodreads.com/alvaroaguirrem) so we can keep each other updated. And please send me an email with your favorite book so I can read it!

In 2017 I graduated from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid with a BSc in Economics. I earned the "Premio Extraordinario de Fin de Carrera" for graduating with the best academic record amongst my cohort. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mguz894hexzxpkp/Premio-madre.jpg?dl=0) is a picture of me receiving the award next to my biggest supporter (my mom!). My Bachelors' Thesis has been published in the VII edition of the Berkeley Economic Review, you can find it [here](https://issuu.com/berkeleyeconreview/docs/berkeley_economic_review_volume_vii).

I received a scholarship to be a visiting student at the University of California, Berkeley, during 2015 and 2016. Here I discovered and explored several fascinating fields of economics, in particular, development and behavioral caught my attention. There I found out what coding was and heard the term "machine learning" for the first time, since it was the topic of almost every conversation in the Bay Area. I found it extremely interesting and am looking forward to learn more about it. 
Nothing says Berkeley more than a [picture with a bear](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3ybj9ffmw2c8sb/Photo%2018-04-2016%2C%2008%2039%2025.jpg?dl=0), or [one at the Oracle Arena](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0od0d4nofx8gpvg/Photo%2003-11-2015%2C%2005%2056%2028.jpg?dl=0) after watching the GSW destroy another team!

I am originally from Perú, and I grew up in a city called Ayacucho, in the highlands of the country. If you have heard about it, probably it is because it was the area most stricken by terrorism in Peru in the 80s and 90s. It is a beautiful place so I highly recommend you check it out if you are in Perú sometime. Take a look at the [Plaza Mayor](https://img.elcomercio.pe/files/article_content_ec_fotos/uploads/2018/03/30/5abef95f528f5.jpeg), or at [this picture](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wmu5a48879q9d5/Photo%2016-05-2017%2C%2000%2032%2054.jpg?dl=0) of me as a kid hanging out with an alpaca.
