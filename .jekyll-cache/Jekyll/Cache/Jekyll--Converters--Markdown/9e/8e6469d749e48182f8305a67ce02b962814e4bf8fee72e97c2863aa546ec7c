I"„<h2 id="guitar-chart">Guitar Chart</h2>

<p>I wrote this chart to help you get more familiar with the fretboard. You will see all the positions written down, starting with the root note R, that can either start on the 6th or 5th string. For flats, move the note one fret up (to the left), and for sharps one fret down (to the right).</p>

<p>If you have received one of the Chord of the Day emails, use this drawing to help you identify the notes!</p>
