<p>I started this little project as a way to create a habit of exploring new sounds and getting out of my comfort zone in guitar playing. The <em>Chord of the Day</em> project sends a daily email with a randomly generated chord. Sometimes you might receive beginner chords, like a simple C major, and other times you might get something more complicated, like a D#m6add9. There are over 50 different types of chords, for 12 roots notes, so more than 600 different chords!</p>

<p>If you want a brief introduction to how chords are constructed, and how the code works, you can check out <a href="./blog/chord_of_the_day.html">this</a> blog entry.</p>
