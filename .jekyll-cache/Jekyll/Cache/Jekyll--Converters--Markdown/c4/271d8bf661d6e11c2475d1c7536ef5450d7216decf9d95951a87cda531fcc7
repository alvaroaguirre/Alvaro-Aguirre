<p>Thanks to lockdown, I recently got back into playing the guitar after a 8-year-long hiatus. When I was younger I was a rock/metal guy trying to play complicated solos on my V-shaped guitar, but those days are long gone. My interests have drifted towards blues, funk and jazz, which require a more comprehensive music theory understanding that I lacked. So, I decided to go back to the basics and learn and study. These genres use a wide variety of chords that as a rock player I had never seen, e.g. notable confusion when trying to play stuff like C#13b5b9. Best way to learn is constant exposure to new chords. I wanted to integrate that to my routine, every day get a new chord that I could explore, so, of course, I decided to write some code that would help me with that. In this blog post you will see the explanation of <a href="https://github.com/alvaroaguirre/Projects/blob/master/ChordOfTheDay/main.py" target="_blank">this code</a>.</p>

<h3 id="getting-started---how-are-chords-constructed">Getting started - How are chords constructed?</h3>

<p>My goal was to randomly generate a chord every day, that would be sent to my email. The first step is obviously to determine how is a chord constructed. Letâ€™s first go through some basics:</p>

<p>The <em>chromatic</em> scale is a sequence of 12 notes, each is one <em>semitone</em> higher than the previous one. For example, if we start with the note <em>A</em>, the next note is <em>A#</em> (A sharp), which is one semitone higher than <em>A</em>. Letâ€™s create a list with the chromatic scale:</p>

<div class="language-python highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="n">chromatic</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s">"A"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"A#"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"B"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"C"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"C#"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"D"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"D#"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"E"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"F"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"F#"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"G"</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">"G#"</span><span class="p">]</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will notice that <em>B</em> and <em>E</em> do not have a sharp. These twelve are all the existing <em>individual notes</em>.</p>

<p>A chord is a collection of at least three individual notes. One of them is the <em>root</em> note, and the others are notes that are at a specific <em>distance</em> from the root. That distance is what determines the type of chord. And what does distance mean in this setting? <em>Distance</em> would mean the number of semitones between two notes. For example, between <em>C</em> and <em>E</em>, we have a distance of 4 semitones, or 2 full tones.</p>

<p>Before creating our first chord, we need to talk about the <em>major scale</em>. This is the most widely used scale and it is extremely important. You might have heard of <em>Do re mi fa sol la si</em>, or, in English notes: <em>C D E F G A B</em>. This is the <em>C</em> major scale. <em>C</em> because the first or <em>root</em> note is <em>C</em>, and <em>major scale</em> because of what notes follow, which are determined by the distance we discussed before. A major scale is constructed following the distances: 2-2-1-2-2-2-1. This means we start at the <em>root</em>, then move 2 semitones higher, and thatâ€™s our second note for the major scale, then move 2 more semitones, and thatâ€™s our third note, and so on.</p>

<p>For the C major scale, letâ€™s look at the chromatic scale and put in bold the notes that are part of the major scale, which follow the 2-2-1-2-2-2-1:</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>, C#, <strong>D</strong>, D#, <strong>E</strong>, <strong>F</strong>, F#, <strong>G</strong>, G#, <strong>A</strong>, A#, <strong>B</strong>, <strong>C</strong></p>

<p>Nice, what about the major scale of <em>D#</em>? We can easily build it using the 2-2-1-2-2-2-1:</p>

<p><strong>D#</strong>, E, <strong>F</strong>, F#, <strong>G</strong>, <strong>G#</strong>, A, <strong>A#</strong>, B, <strong>C</strong>, C#, <strong>D</strong>, <strong>D#</strong></p>
