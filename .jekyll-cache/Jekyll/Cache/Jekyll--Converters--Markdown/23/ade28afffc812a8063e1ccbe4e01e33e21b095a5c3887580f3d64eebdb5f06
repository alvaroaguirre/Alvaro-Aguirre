<p><em>Update April 2021: I have decided to shut down the Chord of the Day project, with the idea of working on an improved version in the future</em></p>

<p>I started this little project as a way to create a habit of exploring new sounds and getting out of my comfort zone in guitar playing. The <em>Chord of the Day</em> project sends a daily email with a randomly generated chord. Sometimes you might receive beginner chords, like a simple C major, and other times you might get something more complicated, like a D#m6add9. There are over 50 different types of chords, for 12 roots notes, so more than 600 different chords!</p>

<p>If you want a brief introduction to how chords are constructed, and how the code works, you can check out <a href="./blog/chord_of_the_day.html" target="_blank">this</a> blog entry. I have also written down a simple chart to help you identify the notes on the fretboard based on their position and build the chords. You can find it <a href="guitar_chart.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>Each email includes the name of the chord, what positions of the major scale construct the chord, a reminder of what is the major scale for that particular root note, and the specific notes that compose the chord.</p>

<p>Also, I have implemented a Twitter bot that daily shares the same chord that is sent by email. You can give it a follow <a href="https://twitter.com/chord_of_day" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
