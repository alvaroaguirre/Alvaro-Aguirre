I"™<h2 id="coffee">Coffee</h2>

<p>One of my biggest passions is specialty coffee. I frequently spend hours in coffee shops reading, and a few years ago I started talking to the baristas and owners trying to learn more about the coffee I was served. Where it came from, what process did the beans go through, how was it brewed. I discovered it was a fantastically complex world. During my masters degree, I explored this passion further by joining the Coffee Society of my College, participating in tastings, visits to cafÃ©s, and learning lots. Brewing coffee is an important part of my days, a very slow and relaxing time for myself.</p>

<p>I have an Instagram account where I post some brewing videos and other coffee related things: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/alvrew/">@alvrew</a>.</p>

<h3 id="beans">Beans</h3>

<p>I collect the bags of coffee I drink. This picture shows most of the beans that accompanied me during my time at the LSE:</p>

<p>My prefered flavour profile is floral/fruity, with remarked acidity and medium sweetness.<br />
Some of the beans I enjoyed brewing the most were:<br />
<em>La Fila</em> by The Barn Coffee Roasters - Sweet Honduras Washed with Plum Jam notes<br />
<em>Sweet Valley - Granja La Esperanza</em> by Red Bank Coffee - A nice Colombian Natural with a strong Riesling finish  <br />
<em>Tsebel</em> by Origin Coffee - Complex Ethiopia Natural with Strawberry and Dark Chocolate notes.</p>

<h3 id="my-gear">My gear</h3>

<p>At the moment, I grind my beans using a Comandante C40 MKIII Nitro Blade - Bamboo. I use a plastic V60 01 and 02 with traditional Hario paper filters, and an Aeropress. I use either Tesco Ashbeck Still Natural Mineral Water, or filtered water using a Brita jug. My server is a Kinto 600ml.</p>
