<p>One of my biggest passions is specialty coffee. I frequently spend hours in coffee shops reading, and a few years ago I started talking to the baristas and owners trying to learn more about the coffee I was served. Where it came from, what process did the beans go through, how was it brewed. I discovered it was a fantastically complex world. During my masters degree, I explored this passion further by joining the Coffee Society of my College, participating in tastings, visits to cafÃ©s, and learning lots. Brewing coffee is an important part of my days, a very slow and relaxing time for myself.</p>

<p>I have created a CafÃ© Map, with my favorite coffeeshops in different parts of the world. Check it out here:</p>

<p>In order to experiment more with my AeroPress (and practice some basic web skills), I created an AeroPress Recipe Generator. You can check it out here: <a href="AeroPressRecipe.html">AeroPress Recipe Generator</a></p>

<h3 id="beans">Beans</h3>

<p>I collect the bags of coffee I drink. This picture shows most of the beans that accompanied me during my time at the LSE:</p>

<p>My prefered flavour profile is floral/fruity, with remarked acidity and medium sweetness.</p>

<p>Some of the beans I enjoyed brewing the most were:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>La Fila</em> by The Barn Coffee Roasters - Sweet Honduras Washed with Plum Jam notes</li>
  <li><em>Sweet Valley - Granja La Esperanza</em> by Red Bank Coffee - A nice Colombian Natural with a strong Riesling finish</li>
  <li><em>Tsebel</em> by Origin Coffee - Complex Ethiopia Natural with Strawberry and Dark Chocolate notes.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="how-do-i-brew">How do I brew?</h3>

<p>At the moment, I grind my beans using a Comandante C40 MKIII Nitro Blade - Bamboo. I use a plastic V60 01 and 02 with traditional Hario paper filters, and an Aeropress.</p>
