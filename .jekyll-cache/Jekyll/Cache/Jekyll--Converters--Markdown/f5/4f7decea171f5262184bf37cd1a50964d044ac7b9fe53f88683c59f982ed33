<h3 id="books">Books</h3>

<p>Reading has always been an essential part of my life. I read around 30 to 40 books a year, both fiction and non-fiction. If you are on Goodreads, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42493361-alvaro-aguirre">add me</a> so we can keep each other posted on what we are reading.</p>

<p>Some of my favorites, that I always recommend, are:<br />
<em>En attendant Bojangles</em> by Olivier Bourdeaut<br />
<em>Gödel, Escher, Bach</em> by Douglas Hofstadter<br />
<em>The Righteous Mind</em> by Jonathan Haidt<br />
<em>Lonesome Dove</em> by Larry McMurtry<br />
<em>Capitães da Areia</em> by Jorge Amado<br />
<em>Nabokov’s Favorite Word is Mauve</em> by Ben Blatt</p>

<p>I am originally from Ayacucho, a small city in the highlands of Perú. If you have heard of it, probably it’s because it was the place striken the worst by terrorism in the 80s and 90s. It is a very important place for me and my family, especially for the strong ties my grandfather had to the city (he even wrote a <a href="https://docplayer.es/59978426-De-huamanga-en-los-anos-sesenta-y-setenta-universitas-huamangensis.html">book</a> about it).</p>

<p>Ayacucho lies in the “Cordillera de los Andes”, with mountains everywhere. This is a great map of the province:</p>

<p>When meeting people from different countries and telling them I am Peruvian, I often get asked about llamas (people unfortunately forget about alpacas and vicuñas). So, in case you were wondering too, here is a picture of me as a kid hanging out with Serafín, a beautiful alpaca:</p>
