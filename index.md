## Who am I and what am I up to?

I am a Graduate student at the LSE pursuing a M.Sc. in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics (more info about my program [here](http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2019/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics)). Currently, I am taking a year off my studies because of health/personal reasons. During this time I am:

* Improving my coding skills (Python, R, MATLAB).
* Learning more math and statistics.
* Exploring the world.

In particular, I am taking the following courses: 

One course from UC Berkeley's Computer Science Department, two courses from UC Berkeley's Data Science Department, two courses from LSE's Mathematics Department, one course from LSE's Statistics Department, and UC Berkeley's math bootcamp for the Economics PhD. 

I am also using this time to read several textbooks such as "Introduction to Statistical Learning" by James, Witten, Hastie and Tibshirani, "Deep Learning" by Goodfellow, "Recursive Macro Theory" by Ljungqvist and Sargent, among others.

## What have I done before?

You can find my complete CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9xs8m1rikbwz24m/CV_sep18.pdf?dl=0). 

I previously spent a year working at Amazon, based in Madrid. I was a Project Manager for Kindle Direct Publishing and led various projects that involved diving deep into data to solve problems or improve processes. Most of the projects used a mix of SQL, VBA, Amazon Redshift, HTML, DaraWarehousing. Some of them were:
* Developed internal tools for making data-driven decisions and negotiating with publishers.
* Analyzed patterns in data and developed a system to detect fraud and abuse in Kindle Unlimited at a global scale (received an EU-wide recognition for the big impact of this project, cut global costs in ~$10M per year, algorithm adopted by BI engineers for regular quality controls).
* Owned Business Intelligence for the 2018 Storyteller Contests in EU (France, Spain, UK, Germany). I aligned and defined the data structure, developed the code that would feed the landing pages and automatically generate weekly reports.
* Used data to understand reading behavior.
* Redesigned and built a new system of reporting for Kindle in Spain, the US and Mexico.
* I also organized several training sessions to teach fellow Amazonians (from Managers to Interns) how to dive deep into data. These included a crash course in SQL programming and how to formulate interesting questions for our business units and answer them using data. I developed all the materials and taught the courses.

Before Amazon, I worked at a small consulting firm in Madrid doing Econometrics, trying to find causal effects. The project consisted on measuring the impact of a training program for insurance managers of the largest Spanish bank on sales. I mainly used STATA for the analysis and regressions, and PowerPoint to present the findings.


## Useful and useless information

In 2017 I graduated from the Universidad Carlos III de Madrid with a BSc in Economics. I earned the "Premio Extraordinario de Fin de Carrera" for graduating with the best academic record amongst my cohort. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/mguz894hexzxpkp/Premio-madre.jpg?dl=0) is a picture of me receiving the award next to my biggest supporter (my mom!).

I received a scholarship to be a visiting student at the University of California, Berkeley, during 2015 and 2016. Here I discovered and explored several fascinating fields of economics, in particular, development and behavioral caught my attention. There I found out what coding was and heard the term "machine learning" for the first time, since it was the topic of almost every conversation in the Bay Area. I found it extremely interesting and am looking forward to learn more about it. 
Nothing says Berkeley more than a [picture with a bear](https://www.dropbox.com/s/s3ybj9ffmw2c8sb/Photo%2018-04-2016%2C%2008%2039%2025.jpg?dl=0), or [one at the Oracle Arena](https://www.dropbox.com/s/0od0d4nofx8gpvg/Photo%2003-11-2015%2C%2005%2056%2028.jpg?dl=0) after watching the GSW destroy another team!

At Berkeley I was part of the [Latin American Leadership Society (LLS)](https://www.llsberkeley.org/) as the Forum Vice-Chair. We organized two forums on relevant topics for the development of Latin America. One of the forums was about the potential impact of the TPP on Latin America, and I was in charge of providing a crash course in International Trade as an opening, a bit of pressure since my International Trade Professor was an assistant and speaker at the Forum. [Here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/g4ghid4xq3yrsoy/lecture%20international%20trade.png?dl=0) is a blurry picture of the talk. [This](https://www.dropbox.com/s/5wdqsylqiz0zjbq/Photo%2019-10-2015%2C%2004%2022%2005.jpg?dl=0) is a picture with the amazing group of people that made LLS happen.

I am originally from Perú, and I grew up in a city called Ayacucho, in the highlands of the country. If you have heard about it, probably it is because it was the area most stricken by terrorism in Peru in the 80s and 90s. It is a beautiful place so I highly recommend you check it out if you are in Perú sometime. Take a look at the [Plaza Mayor](https://img.elcomercio.pe/files/article_content_ec_fotos/uploads/2018/03/30/5abef95f528f5.jpeg), or at [this picture](https://www.dropbox.com/s/1wmu5a48879q9d5/Photo%2016-05-2017%2C%2000%2032%2054.jpg?dl=0) of me as a kid hanging out with a llama.

I also love reading and writing (one of the reasons I ended up working at Kindle). During my time at Berkeley, I got into writing short stories, and one of them, called "Makaha", won 1st prize for the 2016 St Jordi Literary Contest, judged by the Berkeley English Department. While at Berkeley, I had the fantastic experience of living in the International House, a student dorm that aimed to bring people form all cultures and backgrounds together. They hold a yearly contest called the "Barbara Lynch Crossing Borders Essay Awards Program", where students talk about how this experience has changed their perspective on culture and life. I won the 2016 edition and it is probably the essay I have enjoyed writing the most, feel free to [check it out](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j6li2lr8skco9y4/Border%20Crossing.pdf?dl=0).
