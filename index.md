Welcome to my personal webpage. Here you will find information about me, what I am currently up to, the projects I have worked on, and things I am passionate about, like specialty coffee and film photography.

### Who am I and what am I up to?

I am Alvaro. I like data, math, coffee, blues, film photography, and books.

Currently, I am working as a Researcher at the [Systemic Risk Centre](http://www.systemicrisk.ac.uk). My work consists of developing code in Julia, Python, R, and MATLAB for financial risk forecasting algorithms. I will be joining [Bain & Company](https://www.bain.com) in January 2021 as an Associate Consultant in the Madrid office.

I recently completed my masters degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics at the London School of Economics with a Distinction (more info on my program [here](http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2019/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics)), with a full scholarship from the [Fundación Ramón Areces](https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/). Previously, I earned a BSc in Economics from the Universdad Carlos III de Madrid, graduating summa cum laude. I also spent a year as a visiting student at UC Berkeley.

### What have I done before?

You can download my CV [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/9xs8m1rikbwz24m/CV_AlvaroAguirre.pdf?dl=1).

After finishing my bachelor's degree, I spent a year working at Amazon. I was a Project Manager focused on Data for the Kindle team. I led various projects that involved diving deep into data to solve fun problems or improve internal processes. Most of the projects used a mix of SQL, VBA, Amazon Redshift, HTML, DaraWarehousing, and R. I also organized and gave workshops on SQL coding and how to pose and answer interesting questions using data. 

Before Amazon, I worked at a small consulting firm in Madrid doing Econometrics modeling, trying to find causal effects. The project consisted on measuring the impact of a training program for insurance managers of the largest Spanish bank on sales. I mainly used STATA for the analysis and regressions.
