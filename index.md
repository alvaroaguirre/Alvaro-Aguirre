Welcome to my personal webpage. Here you will find information about me, what I am up to, the projects I have worked on, and things I am passionate about, like specialty coffee and film photography.

### Who am I and what am I up to?

I am Alvaro. I like data, math, coffee, blues, film photography, and books.

Currently, I am working as a Quantitative Researcher at the [Systemic Risk Centre](http://www.systemicrisk.ac.uk). My main project nowadays consists on developing algorithms for the early identification and trading of financial bubbles in the US stock market. Other projects include using spectral analysis to study rental price cycles in different European countries, creating teaching and programming material for a postgraduate class at the LSE, and building data frameworks for financial research papers. Most of my work is in R, but some other projects involved using Python, Julia, and MATLAB. [Here](https://voxeu.org/article/which-programming-language-best-economic-research) you will find a VOX EU article I wrote with Jon Danielsson about the comparison of these four languages for economic research.

I recently completed my masters degree in Econometrics and Mathematical Economics at the London School of Economics with a Distinction (more info on my program [here](http://www.lse.ac.uk/study-at-lse/Graduate/Degree-programmes-2019/MSc-Econometrics-and-Mathematical-Economics)), with a full scholarship from the [Fundación Ramón Areces](https://www.fundacionareces.es/fundacionareces/en/). Previously, I earned a BSc in Economics from the Universdad Carlos III de Madrid, graduating summa cum laude. I also spent a year as a visiting student at UC Berkeley.

### What have I done before?

You can get my CV [here](/assets/docs/CV_AlvaroAguirre.pdf).

After finishing my bachelor's degree, I spent a year working at Amazon. I was a Project Manager focused on Data for the Kindle team. I led various projects that involved diving deep into data to solve fun problems or improve internal processes. Most of the projects used a mix of SQL, VBA, Amazon Redshift, HTML, DaraWarehousing, and R. I also organized and gave workshops on SQL coding and how to pose and answer interesting questions using data. 

Before Amazon, I worked at a small consulting firm in Madrid doing Econometrics modeling, trying to find causal effects. The project consisted on measuring the impact of a training program for insurance managers of the largest Spanish bank on sales. I mainly used STATA for the analysis and regressions.
