## R and quantitative finance

During my time at the Systemic Risk Centre, I created material for the LSE postgraduate class *FM442: Quantitative Methods for Finance and Risk Management*, taught by Jon Danielsson. Apart from exploring the contents of the course, the eight self-contained seminars aimed to teach students how to work with R, the statistical computing software. You can also find a set of weekly assignments, and an support notebook designed to help students get comfortable with R:
